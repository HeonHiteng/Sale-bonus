You are asked to display monthly sales information for organization X. Among the
relevant information are total monthly sales for three products A, B and C that a
salesperson manages to sell. You need to calculate and siaply the total bonus
obtained by each salesperson based on information in Table 1.


The target monthly sale for each product is as follows:

Product A: RM5,000

Product B: RM1,000

Product C: RM2,500


Write a program that accepts as input the monthly sales achievements for 𝑛
salespersons and calculate the total bonus obtained by each salesperson. Refer to
Figure 1 for the desired input and output.
You also need to produce a flowchart for your program 😊
